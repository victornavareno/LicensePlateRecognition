# License Plate Recognition with Python and OpenCV 
### Created by Victor Navare√±o

This project detects and reads license plates from vehicle images using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR. The program extracts the region of the license plate and recognizes the text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This can be useful for various applications like automatic parking systems, traffic monitoring, and more.

## Features
- **License plate detection** using OpenCV's image processing techniques.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to read the text from the license plate using Tesseract.
- Version 1.0 Works with static images.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need to install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
